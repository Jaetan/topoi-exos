# Background

This repository contains solutions to a selection of exercises from Robert Goldblatt's "Topoi, a categorial analysis of logic". I am writing these solutions as I work my way through this book.

# Contents

The repository contains the LaTeX sources for the solutions, named after the section the exercises appear in, as well as the PDF produced from these sources. The LaTeX version used to compile the sources comes from the texlive and AMS packages available in the stable Debian distribution. For compilation, the latex-mf package available in the same distribution is used.
